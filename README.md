# Financial Modeling & Investment Analysis in MS Excel

This repository contains a complete 5-year financial model constructed using a structured approach based on a real case study. The model includes projections for the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement with clearly defined assumptions.

## Steps Followed in the Financial Modeling Process

1. Creating the financial model structure
2. Analyzing historical financials
3. Projecting revenues
4. Projecting costs
5. Projecting depreciation
6. Projecting working capital
7. Completing the cash flow statement
8. Projecting debt
9. Balancing the balance sheet
